# Organization README

Since September 2021 GitHub allows organizations to customize their profile. You just have to create a repository named `.github` in your organization.

This is the `.github` repository of red6. If you want to learn more about what you can do with it, take a look at the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile).
